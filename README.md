# MNIST for PFGMs

Currently a WIP, but the goal of this repo is to implement the [Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11178) in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax)/[Flax](https://github.com/google/flax). 

For further resources on PFGMs check this great [blog post](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/an-introduction-to-poisson-flow-generative-models/), as well as, this very informative [Observable Notebook](https://observablehq.com/@dkirkby/poisson-flow) made by my research advisor David Kirkby. 

Lastly, I plan on making the code very thorough/clear, so if you find that you have any questions or suggestions please feel free to email me at mdowicz@uci.edu.
